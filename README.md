# Predictive-Typing-Performance-Analysis
A 'Predictive Typing Performance Analysis' is a project focused on developing and deploying a machine learning model to predict typing speed and accuracy based on the dataset. By leveraging advanced techniques and algorithms such as linear regression (optional: decision trees and neural networks), this project aims to accurately forecast typing performance metrics, enabling users to identify areas for improvement and track their progress over time.

More Info:

• How does it work? The project utilizes machine learning algorithm like linear regression to predict typing speed and accuracy based on historical data and relevant features such as typing patterns, error rates, and practice duration.

• Resources: (1.) Python programming language; (2.) Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation; (3.) Matplotlib for data visualization; (4.) Version control using Git.

• Showcased at (off-site): IEEE Xplore (ongoing).
